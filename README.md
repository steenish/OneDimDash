# OneDimDash
A game currently in development. It is played in one dimension and therefore only has one controllable aspect, the speed. Playing the game means avoiding obstacles by matching the speed requirement of the obstacle. The game (I just lost the game) therefore focuses on reaction speed and competing for the highest score.

Since this is a one-person project and it was almost complete by the time this repo was created, the repo is mostly used as a backup.

## Feature list:
* Fast-paced gameplay
* 2D graphics (because of course you cannot ACTUALLY play a game in one dimension)
* Keyboard game controls 
* Mouse and keyboard controlled shell menus
* Scoring and local high scores
* Music and sound effects
